    "- A decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the feature space into regions that are increasingly homogeneous with respect to the target variable. At each step, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into distinct classes. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth or no further improvement in purity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make predictions, the decision tree traverses down from the root node to a leaf node based on the values of the features of the input instance. Each internal node corresponds to a decision based on the value of a specific feature, and each leaf node represents a class label. When a new instance is presented to the tree, it follows the decision path from the root to a leaf, and the majority class in that leaf is assigned as the predicted class for the instance."
